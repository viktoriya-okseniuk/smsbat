          to locate the material;
        </li>
        <li data-v-6dfe8f46="">
          Information reasonably sufficient to permit Counterbat to contact you,

        <li data-v-6dfe8f46="">

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-5" data-v-6dfe8f46="">Counter notification</h2>
      <p data-v-6dfe8f46="">
        As the registered user who uploaded the allegedly infringing content,
        you may submit a counter notification to the Copyright Agent. To be
        effective, your counter notification must be a written communication
        provided to the Copyright Agent that includes substantially the
        following:
      </p>
      <ol data-v-6dfe8f46="">
        <li data-v-6dfe8f46="">Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li data-v-6dfe8f46="">
          Identification of the material to which access has been disabled and
          the location at which the material appeared before access to it was
          disabled.
        </li>
        <li data-v-6dfe8f46="">
          A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief
          that the material was disabled as a result of mistake or
          misidentification of the material to be disabled;
        </li>
        <li data-v-6dfe8f46="">
          Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you
          consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the
          judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address
          is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which
          you may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the
          person who provided notification or an agent of such person.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p data-v-6dfe8f46="">
        After receipt of a counter notification, Counterbat will promptly
        provide the person who submitted the claimed copyright infringement
        notification with a copy of the counter notification, and will inform
        that person that Counterbat will replace the removed material, or cease
        disabling access to that material 10 business days.
      </p>
      <p data-v-6dfe8f46="">
        Counterbat will then replace the removed the material and cease
        disabling access to it between 10 to 14 business days following receipt
        of the counter notification, unless the Copyright Agent first receives
        notice from the person who notified Counterbat of the claimed copyright
        infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order
        to restrain the registered user from engaging in infringing activity
        relating to the material on Counterbat's system or network.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-5" data-v-6dfe8f46="">Repeat infringements</h2>
      <p data-v-6dfe8f46="">
        Counterbat may deny or cancel any individual use of the Service, or
        terminate your user account, if Counterbat determines in its sole
        discretion that you are a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a user
        who has been notified of infringing activity more than once or a user
        that his or her uploaded material was removed from the Service more than
        once. Counterbat may decide, at its sole discretion that a sufficient
        reason exists for the immediate termination of your account for any
        reason, at any time. In these case Counterbat may terminate your account
        immediately. Counterbat may notify you that it canceled your account by
        sending a message to the e-mail address that you provided during the
        registration process. Such notification will come into effect
        immediately.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-5" data-v-6dfe8f46="">Misrepresentations</h2>
      <p data-v-6dfe8f46="">
        Under the provisions of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially
        misrepresents: (1) that material is infringing, or (2) that material was
        removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for
        any damages, including costs and attorneysâ€™ fees, that Counterbat may
        incur, if it is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of its
        reliance upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to
        the material claimed to be infringing.
