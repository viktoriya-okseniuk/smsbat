        Changes to this Privacy Policy
      </h3>
      <p data-v-75d35b0d="">
        From time to time, we will update this policy. If the updates have minor
        if any consequences, they will take effect 7 days after we post a notice
        on the Service's website. Substantial changes will be effective 30 days
        after we initially posted the notice.
      </p>
      <p data-v-75d35b0d="">
        Until the new policy takes effect, if it materially reduces the
        protection of your privacy right under the then-existing policy you can
        choose not to accept it and terminate your use of the Service.
        Continuing to use the Service after the new policy takes effect means
        that you agree to the new policy. Note that if we need to adapt the
        policy to legal requirements, the new policy will become effective
        immediately or as required by law.
