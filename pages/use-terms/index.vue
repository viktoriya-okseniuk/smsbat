          Counterbat and anyone on Counterbat’s behalf in connection therewith.
          If an invoiced amount is not received by Counterbat by its due date,
          then, without derogating from any other remedies available to it,
          Counterbat may charge a late payment interest at a rate of 1.5% of the
          unpaid amount per month, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by
          applicable law, and shall be entitled to reasonable expenses incurred
          (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with the

          “Confidential Information” means any information furnished or made
          available by one party to the other, that is identified as
          “confidential” or “proprietary,” either by legend on written or
          electronically stored material, or which ought reasonably to be
          recognized as confidential or proprietary by virtue of its nature or
          the circumstances of its disclosure. The foregoing will not be
          considered as Confidential Information of a party: (a) is or becomes
          available to the public through no breach of the receiving party; (b)
          was rightfully known without restriction on use or disclosure prior to
          such information being disclosed or made available to the receiving

          third party, except as specifically required to provide or receive the
          Services, or subject to the other party’s prior permission. Each of
          you and Counterbat will take precautions to maintain the
          confidentiality of the other party’s Confidential Information with the
          same degree of care as to its own Confidential Information, but in no
          case less than reasonable care. Upon termination of these Terms,
          either party will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete all
          copies of the other’s Confidential Information that is stored on its
          system or in its possession, except for retaining data for legitimate
          business purposes or as required under applicable laws, including
